*Question 1*  

 
From: marissa@startup.com  
Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  
  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  
   
Thanks,  
Marissa

Hi Marissa,

Thank you for your feedback, we strive to improve our product and make the most user friendly experience we can. While the new dashboard design may take a little getting used to, it has been updated to streamline our process and make it easier to use. I understand your frustration with the new design, so I’d like to schedule a meeting with you where I can demonstrate the new features and teach you how to use them to your advantage. 

I am available as early as tomorrow morning, at your convenience.

*Question 2*:   
  
From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  
  
Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  
  
Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.   

Response: 
Hi Carrie,

This issue is caused by exceeding the records used in your quota. The solution, which will reduce your records used, is to reduce the metadata you enrich each record with that is not used for search. Removing this extra metadata will allow the search to run properly. 

I am available for any further questions you may have.

Hi, my website is not working and here's the error:  
  
![error message](./error.png)  
  
Can you fix it please?  

Response:

Hi Marc,

This appears to be an error in the code using Algolia’s API. Searchkit is another search tool that consists of a number of components that communicate with your search. Algolia is a complete set of tools for building search, and thus does not need Searchkit to run properly. 

I’d be happy to explain this further and show you how to remedy the code at your earliest convenience.
